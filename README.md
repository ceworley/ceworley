I am making open-source introductory statistics materials. You can see a [preview of my questions](https://ceworley.github.io/statqs/), and **video explanations** are linked in the answers. The numbers (and sometimes wording) are randomly generated.

I like using archery as a context for statistics. For example, should this archer adjust the horizontal aspect of her sight?

I use spinners to display probability distributions (in addition to density curves and cumulative curves). For example, I think a spinner easily shows that P(Z<1)=0.841.

(Notice the standard uniform distribution is marked on the outside of the spinner to quantify probability)
